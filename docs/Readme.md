# Introduction
The document section of this project is where I am going to comment on the
various aspects of the design of the application.  I will make little notes on
various aspects of my decisions here.  This document will act as the index.

There is a README.md file at top level of the project.  This will just act as an
introduction to the project and can then direct readers to this directory for
more detailed explanation.

# Document list
- Api.md  Details of the api structure
